This project is a tool that will help you win in Scrabble! The simple GUI allows you to enter any amount of characters, outputting a list of valid words sorted in order of Scrabble points. 

I hope to return to this project to implement more features such as:
- "must include this letter" feature 
- "other words on the board" feature

Another way I could add to this project is to build a Scrabble Game in Unity and implemment this program as AI.
